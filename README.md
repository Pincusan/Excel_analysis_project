# Databel Customer Churn Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company called **Databel**. Using a sample dataset created purely for educational purposes, the primary goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns in customer behavior, identify the key drivers causing customers to cancel their subscriptions, and present these findings clearly to help inform business decisions.

## Key Business Questions Analyzed
In this project, I explored the data to answer several critical business questions such as:
* **Demographic Trends:** How do factors like age (e.g., Seniors vs. Under 30) and geographic location impact the likelihood of a customer leaving?
* **The Cost of Friction:** At what point do customer service interactions indicate a high flight risk? (Revealing a massive spike in churn after a customer makes 3+ support calls).
* **Plan Mismatches (Surprise Fees):** Investigating the financial impact of customers who incur high extra charges because they lack an International Plan, versus those who overpay for plans they don't use. 

## Skills Showcased
This project was built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, focusing heavily on intermediate level data manipulation and reporting techniques:
* **Pivot Tables:** Aggregating large datasets to calculate precise churn rates across dozens of customer dimensions.
* **Logical Formulas:** Utilizing `IF` functions and other data-cleaning techniques to categorize customers and group raw data into meaningful buckets (e.g., grouping ages or monthly charges).
* **Data Visualization:** Creating strategic charts, specifically Combo Charts with Secondary Axes, to properly compare metrics with different scales (like comparing a percentage-based Churn Rate against dollar-based Extra Charges).
* **Reporting:** Compiling individual Pivot Charts into a clean, static reporting sheet to provide a short summary of the company's health.

*Note: The original dataset and initial guided structure for this project are from a [DataCamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-excel). To further challenge myself, I investigated the inconsistency of international usage and support call thresholds and created custom visualizations to highlight those specific insights.*
